      "title": "Absence of Auditable Source Code",
      "description": "The repository audit could only evaluate the documentation (README). Since no source code (e.g., application logic, configuration files, dependency manifests) was present, a comprehensive security analysis for common threats (SQLi, XSS, Dependency Vulnerabilities) or code quality assessment is impossible. The project context implies a functional 'Test Project,' which is currently not verifiable."

    {
      "severity": "Medium",
      "title": "Critical Documentation Failure",
      "description": "The existing README is minimal ('Hello World!'). It fails to provide essential information required for developer onboarding, system operation, or compliance. Missing elements include: project architecture, setup instructions, dependency lists, licensing information, and contribution guidelines."
    },
    {
      "severity": "Low",
      "title": "Inclusion of Unrelated Internal Metadata",
      "description": "The line '# Limit context to avoid errors, though Flash-Latest handles 1M+' appears to be an internal note related to the audit process or tool constraints, rather than project documentation. This irrelevant metadata should be removed to maintain professional integrity and clarity in user-facing documents."

    "Remove all extraneous comments and internal metadata from public-facing documentation files (such as the README)."
