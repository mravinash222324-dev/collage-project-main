Title: Jarvi: The Offline AI Assistant
AI Summary: The new submission, 'Jarvi: The Offline AI Assistant,' is distinct from all existing projects in the database. While some projects utilize AI for accessibility (P#25) or address data privacy (P#18), none focus on developing a 100% offline, generalized Large Language Model (LLM) assistant optimized for local inference on mobile devices (Android) as its primary function and innovation. The technical approach leveraging llama.cpp and GGUF quantized models for dedicated offline use cases provides a novel implementation. The project is approved.

  "title": "AI Voice Code Assistant for Lab Exams: Making Programming Exams Accessible",
  "abstract_text": "The AI Voice Code Assistant project addresses significant accessibility and performance barriers encountered by students during timed programming lab exams. These challenges include limitations imposed by slow typing speeds, physical disabilities that hinder efficient keyboard use, and the highly keyboard-dependent nature of traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). These factors often lead to increased stress and create an unequal playing field for diverse learners.\r\n\r\nThe core objective is to develop an innovative, online voice-based tool that facilitates truly hands-free coding. This assistant leverages advanced AI/NLP to convert spoken code syntax into accurate C/C++ code in real-time. Key features include highly accurate voice input transcription for standard C/C++ syntax, instant code generation, seamless file export (.c/.cpp), and an accessibility-first user interface (UI) designed with high contrast, large click areas, and minimal typing reliance. The system simplifies the coding process by translating natural language commands (e.g., 'Print hello') directly into precise, compiler-ready code.\r\n\r\nOptimized specifically for rigorous exam environments, the tool focuses exclusively on relevant C/C++ syntax and maintains a clean, distraction-free layout to uphold exam integrity. The project provides transformative benefits by empowering students with physical or learning disabilities, reducing performance pressure related to typing speed, and streamlining educator workflows. Future development includes expanding multi-language support (Java, Python), integrating an online compiler for real-time execution, implementing voice-controlled debugging, and fine-tuning the AI model based on specific curriculum standards.\r\n\r\n**Tech Stack:** AI/Machine Learning (General), Natural Language Processing (NLP), C/C++, Web Development (Front-end/Back-end), Java (Future Scope), Python (Future Scope)\r\n**Tools:** Turbo C++ (Compiler), GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)",
