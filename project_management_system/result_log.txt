Most Similar Project: {'title': 'AI-Powered College Project Management System', 'abstract_text': 'The proposed system addresses significant inefficiencies in traditional academic project management, which relies on manual submissions, inconsistent plagiarism checks, lack of centralized tracking, and time-consuming, synchronous viva sessions. The existing environment results in scattered and unsearchable academic history.\r\n\r\nOur solution is an AI-driven, centralized platform designed to manage the entire college project lifecycle, from submission to archiving, utilizing a decoupled REST API architecture built with Django and React. The system introduces intelligent automation through comprehensive modules, including automated AI plagiarism checks, standardized AI scoring (assessing Relevance, Feasibility, and Innovation), and a Project Lifecycle Management module to track status updates. A key feature is the Persistent AI Viva module, which offers on-demand, AI-generated simulations, saving detailed questions, answers, scores, and feedback for review.\r\n\r\nThe methodology employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI techniques, primarily leveraging Google Gemini for semantic similarity, text generation, and answer evaluation. The platform also implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, enabling a Context-Aware AI Assistant to augment AI prompts with structured database data, providing faculty and administrators with instant, context-specific answers. The goal is to provide a standardized, searchable, and efficient management portal supporting role-based authentication for students, teachers, and administrators.\r\n\r\n**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Google Generative AI (Gemini), Sentence Transformers, Whisper (Audio Transcription), React.js, TypeScript, Vite, Chakra UI, Axios, SQLite, Web Engineering (Architecture), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)', 'student': 'AVINASH3'}

Full Report: This submission is a duplicate of Project #24: AI-Powered College Project Management System, with identical goals, functionality, and end goals. The proposed system addresses significant inefficiencies in traditional academic project management, which relies on manual submissions, inconsistent plagiarism checks, lack of centralized tracking, and time-consuming, synchronous viva sessions. The existing environment results in scattered and unstructured project data, leading to difficulties in tracking student progress and providing timely feedback. The proposed system employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI techniques, including Google Gemini for semantic similarity, text generation, and answer evaluation, to automate plagiarism checks, scoring, and viva simulations.
